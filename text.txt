Hello today we are going to build a text to speech service which will use :-
1. S3
2. Polly
3. Aws Lambda

We will have two S3 buckets, one in which the text files will be uploaded and then that uploadation 
will act as an event source for triggering the lambda function which which then take the text from .txt file
and send it to polly to convert it to mp3 file and then upload that mp3 file to the s3 second bucket.

Thanks.
